## ‚úÖ Conclusion

SMART rethinks the ERC-3643 architecture by moving modularity, configuration, and verification closer to the token layer. This creates a more flexible, reusable, and standards-compliant framework for compliant token issuance in dynamic regulatory environments. By decoupling identity and compliance logic from any single token, SMART improves scalability and opens doors for broader cross-application identity use.

## üöÄ How to Use SMART Protocol

### **Quick Start: Asset Tokenization**

1. **Deploy System Infrastructure**

   ```solidity
   // Deploy the core system with identity and compliance infrastructure
   SMARTSystemFactory systemFactory = new SMARTSystemFactory();
   SMARTSystem system = systemFactory.deploySystem(
       "MyProject",
       systemAdmin,
       complianceAdmin
   );
   ```

2. **Create Asset-Specific Tokens**

   ```solidity
   // Deploy a bond token
   SMARTBondFactory bondFactory = system.getBondFactory();
   SMARTBondProxy bond = bondFactory.deployToken(
       "Green Bond 2024",
       "GB24",
       18,
       systemAdmin,
       [Topics.KYC, Topics.ACCREDITED_INVESTOR] // Required claims
   );
   ```

3. **Set Up Identity and Compliance**

   ```solidity
   // Register investors with required claims
   SMARTIdentity investorIdentity = system.createIdentity(investorAddress);

   // Issue KYC claim through trusted issuer
   system.getTrustedIssuersRegistry().addTrustedIssuer(
       kycProviderIdentity,
       [Topics.KYC]
   );

   // Investor gets verified through KYC provider
   kycProvider.issueClaim(investorIdentity, Topics.KYC, kycData);
   ```

4. **Configure Token Extensions**

   ```solidity
   // Add yield distribution capability
   bond.addExtension(address(new SMARTYield()));

   // Set up custodian controls
   bond.addExtension(address(new SMARTCustodian()));

   // Enable token redemption
   bond.addExtension(address(new SMARTRedeemable()));
   ```

### **Advanced Usage Patterns**

#### **Multi-Jurisdiction Compliance**

```solidity
// Set up country-specific rules
CountryAllowListModule allowList = new CountryAllowListModule();
allowList.addAllowedCountry("US");
allowList.addAllowedCountry("EU");

CountryBlockListModule blockList = new CountryBlockListModule();
blockList.addBlockedCountry("OFAC_SANCTIONED");

// Apply to compliance
system.getCompliance().addModule(address(allowList));
system.getCompliance().addModule(address(blockList));
```

#### **Custom Yield Schedules**

```solidity
// Fixed yield schedule for bonds
SMARTFixedYieldSchedule schedule = new SMARTFixedYieldSchedule();
schedule.setYieldRate(5 * 10**16); // 5% annual yield
schedule.setPaymentFrequency(90 days); // Quarterly

bond.setYieldSchedule(address(schedule));
```

#### **Collateral Management**

```solidity
// Require collateral proof for high-value transfers
SMARTCollateral collateralExt = SMARTCollateral(bond.getExtension("SMARTCollateral"));
collateralExt.setCollateralRequirement(
    1000 * 10**18, // Amounts over 1000 tokens
    collateralProofContract
);
```

### **Integration Examples**

#### **DeFi Integration**

```solidity
// SMART tokens work with any ERC-20 compatible protocol
// Example: Uniswap V3 liquidity provision
IUniswapV3Factory factory = IUniswapV3Factory(UNISWAP_V3_FACTORY);
IUniswapV3Pool pool = factory.createPool(
    address(smartToken),
    address(usdc),
    3000 // 0.3% fee
);

// Note: Compliance rules still apply to all transfers
```

#### **Cross-Chain Asset Bridging**

```solidity
// Bridge assets while maintaining compliance
function bridgeAsset(
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 destinationChain,
    address recipient
) external {
    // Compliance check before bridging
    require(ISMART(token).canTransfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount), "Transfer not compliant");

    // Bridge logic...
    bridgeContract.lockAndMint(token, amount, destinationChain, recipient);
}
```

### **Common Use Cases**

| **Use Case**               | **Asset Type**  | **Key Extensions**             | **Compliance Requirements**           |
