- Configure ESLint to use the recommended rules as a starting point
- Extend your configuration with plugins relevant to your tech stack (e.g., @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin for TypeScript)
- Use .eslintignore to exclude files or directories that don't need linting
- Implement a pre-commit hook to run ESLint before committing code
- Regularly update ESLint and its plugins to benefit from the latest rules and improvements
- ALWAYS fix all linter warnings too, not only errors. We have a ZERO WARNING policy.
  - we especially require block statements, even for simple if and switch statements
