/// @title SMART Compliance Contract Implementation
/// @author SettleMint Tokenization Services
/// @notice This contract is the upgradeable logic implementation for the main compliance functionality within the SMART
/// Protocol.
/// @dev It acts as a central orchestrator for compliance checks related to SMART tokens (which implement the `ISMART`
/// interface).
/// When a SMART token operation occurs (like a transfer, creation, or destruction of tokens),
/// this compliance contract is notified. It then iterates through all compliance modules registered
/// with that specific token and calls the relevant functions (hooks) on each module.
/// For example, before a transfer, it checks `canTransfer` on all modules. After a transfer, it calls `transferred`.
/// This contract is designed to be used behind a proxy (like `SMARTComplianceProxy`) to allow its logic to be upgraded.
/// It supports meta-transactions via `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable` allowing a trusted forwarder to pay for gas fees.
/// It also implements `ERC165Upgradeable` for interface detection.
