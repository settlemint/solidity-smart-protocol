/// @title Country Allow-List Compliance Module
/// @author SettleMint Tokenization Services
/// @notice This compliance module restricts token transfers *to* users unless their registered country is on an
/// approved list.
/// @dev It inherits from `AbstractCountryComplianceModule` and implements a country-based allow-list logic.
/// The module combines two sources for the allow-list:
/// 1. **Global Allow-List**: A list of country codes maintained within this specific module instance.
///    This list can be managed by addresses holding the `GLOBAL_LIST_MANAGER_ROLE` (inherited from
/// `AbstractCountryComplianceModule`).
/// 2. **Token-Specific Allow-List**: An additional list of country codes provided via the `_params` argument when this
/// module
///    is registered with a particular `ISMART` token. The format for these parameters is `abi.encode(uint16[] memory
/// additionalAllowedCountries)`.
/// A transfer *to* a recipient is PERMITTED if:
///    - The recipient has no identity registered in the token's `ISMARTIdentityRegistry`, or their country code is 0.
///      (In this case, the module cannot determine the country, so it defaults to allowing the transfer).
///    - OR the recipient's registered country code is present in this module instance's global allow-list.
///    - OR the recipient's registered country code is present in the token-specific list of allowed countries passed
/// via `_params`.
/// If none of these conditions are met, the `canTransfer` function will revert with a `ComplianceCheckFailed` error,
/// effectively blocking the transfer.
/// @custom:parameters The `_params` data for this module should be ABI-encoded as a dynamic array of `uint16` country
/// codes:
///                   `abi.encode(uint16[] memory additionalAllowedCountries)`. These are countries allowed *in
/// addition* to the global list for a specific token.
