/// @title Country Block-List Compliance Module
/// @author SettleMint Tokenization Services
/// @notice This compliance module restricts token transfers *to* users if their registered country is on a prohibited
/// list (block-list).
/// @dev It inherits from `AbstractCountryComplianceModule` and implements a country-based block-list logic.
/// The module combines two sources for the block-list:
/// 1. **Global Block-List**: A list of country codes maintained within this specific module instance.
///    This list can be managed by addresses holding the `GLOBAL_LIST_MANAGER_ROLE` (inherited from
/// `AbstractCountryComplianceModule`).
/// 2. **Token-Specific Block-List**: An additional list of country codes provided via the `_params` argument when this
/// module
///    is registered with a particular `ISMART` token. The format for these parameters is `abi.encode(uint16[] memory
/// additionalBlockedCountries)`.
/// A transfer *to* a recipient is BLOCKED (i.e., `canTransfer` reverts) if:
///    - The recipient has a registered identity in the token's `ISMARTIdentityRegistry` AND their country code is known
/// (not 0),
///    - AND the recipient's registered country code is present in this module instance's global block-list,
///    - OR the recipient's registered country code is present in the token-specific list of blocked countries passed
/// via `_params`.
/// If the recipient has no identity or their country code is 0, the transfer is implicitly ALLOWED by this module
/// because it cannot determine if they are from a blocked country.
/// Similarly, if their known country is not on any block-list, the transfer is allowed.
/// @custom:parameters The `_params` data for this module should be ABI-encoded as a dynamic array of `uint16` country
/// codes:
///                   `abi.encode(uint16[] memory additionalBlockedCountries)`. These are countries blocked *in
/// addition* to the global list for a specific token.
