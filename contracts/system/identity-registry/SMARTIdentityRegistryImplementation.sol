/// @author SettleMint Tokenization Services
/// @notice This contract is the upgradeable logic for the SMART Identity Registry. It manages on-chain investor
/// identities
/// and their associated data, adhering to the ERC-3643 standard for tokenized assets.
/// @dev This implementation relies on separate contracts for storing identity data (`ISMARTIdentityRegistryStorage`)
/// and for managing trusted claim issuers (`IERC3643TrustedIssuersRegistry`).
/// It uses OpenZeppelin's `AccessControlUpgradeable` for role-based access control,
/// `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable` for meta-transaction support (allowing transactions to be relayed by a trusted
/// forwarder),
/// and is designed to be upgradeable using the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern.
