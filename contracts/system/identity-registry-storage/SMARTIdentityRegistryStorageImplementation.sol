/// @title SMART Identity Registry Storage Implementation
/// @author SettleMint Tokenization Services
/// @notice This contract is the core logic for storing and managing identity-related data for the SMART Protocol.
/// It acts as a persistent data layer for `SMARTIdentityRegistry` contracts, which handle the business logic of
/// identity registration and verification. This separation allows the storage logic to be upgraded independently.
/// @dev This contract implements `ISMARTIdentityRegistryStorage`, a standard interface for storing data related to
/// ERC-3643 compliant identity registries. This includes mapping user wallet addresses to their `IIdentity` contracts
/// (which hold identity claims like KYC/AML status) and their country codes (for compliance purposes).
/// It uses `AccessControlUpgradeable` to manage permissions:
///    - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: This role has the highest level of control. It can grant or revoke any other role,
///      including `MANAGE_REGISTRIES_ROLE`. Typically held by a secure multi-signature wallet or a DAO.
///    - `MANAGE_REGISTRIES_ROLE`: This role is responsible for managing which `SMARTIdentityRegistry` contracts
///      are allowed to interact with this storage. It can bind new registry contracts (granting them
///      `STORAGE_MODIFIER_ROLE`) and unbind existing ones. This role is usually assigned to a system controller
///      contract like `SMARTSystem` or an identity factory.
///    - `STORAGE_MODIFIER_ROLE`: This role is granted to `SMARTIdentityRegistry` contracts that have been "bound"
///      to this storage. Contracts with this role are authorized to call functions that add, remove, or update
///      identity data within this storage contract (e.g., `addIdentityToStorage`, `modifyStoredInvestorCountry`).
/// The contract supports meta-transactions through `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable`, allowing users to interact with it
/// via a trusted forwarder, potentially paying gas fees in tokens other than Ether.
/// It is designed to be upgradeable using the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern, meaning the
/// upgrade logic resides within this implementation contract itself.
/// The contract also maintains lists of all registered identity wallets and all bound registry contracts, which can
/// be useful for enumeration, auditing, or administrative purposes.
