# Identity Extensions

This directory contains modular extensions for identity functionality. These implementations are based on the OnchainId protocol but have been restructured to be more flexible and reusable:

- Split into multiple focused extensions for better separation of concerns
- Made overridable to allow for customization and different use cases
- Designed to be more generic and composable

This approach allows for:

- Better maintainability through smaller, focused contracts
- Easier testing and verification
- More flexibility in implementation choices
- Reusability across different identity systems
