/// @author SettleMint Tokenization Services
/// @notice This contract is the upgradeable logic implementation for creating and managing on-chain identities
///         for both user wallets and token contracts within the SMART Protocol.
/// @dev It leverages OpenZeppelin's `Create2` library to deploy identity proxy contracts (`SMARTIdentityProxy` for
/// wallets,
///      `SMARTTokenIdentityProxy` for tokens) at deterministic addresses. These proxies point to logic implementations
///      whose addresses are provided by the central `ISMARTSystem` contract, enabling upgradeability of the identity
/// logic.
///      The factory uses `AccessControlUpgradeable` for role-based access control, notably the
/// `REGISTRAR_ROLE`
///      for creating identities. It is also `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable` for meta-transaction support.
///      The identities created are based on the ERC725 (OnchainID) standard, managed via ERC734 for key management.
