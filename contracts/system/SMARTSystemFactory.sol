// --- Contract Definition ---

/// @title SMARTSystemFactory
/// @author SettleMint Tokenization Services
/// @notice This contract serves as a factory for deploying new instances of the `SMARTSystem` contract.
/// @dev It simplifies the deployment of `SMARTSystem` by using a predefined set of default implementation addresses
/// for the various modules (compliance, identity registry, etc.) that `SMARTSystem` manages.
/// This factory also supports meta-transactions through OpenZeppelin's `ERC2771Context`, allowing users to interact
/// with it (e.g., to create a new `SMARTSystem`) without paying for gas directly, provided a trusted forwarder is used.
/// The factory keeps track of all `SMARTSystem` instances it creates.
