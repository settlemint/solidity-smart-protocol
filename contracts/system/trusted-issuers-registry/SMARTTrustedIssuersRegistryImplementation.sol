/// @title SMART Trusted Issuers Registry Implementation
/// @author SettleMint Tokenization Services
/// @notice This contract is the upgradeable logic for managing a registry of trusted claim issuers and the specific
/// claim topics they are authorized to issue claims for. It is compliant with the `IERC3643TrustedIssuersRegistry`
/// interface, a standard for tokenization platforms.
/// @dev This registry plays a crucial role in decentralized identity and verifiable credential systems. It allows
/// relying parties (e.g., smart contracts controlling access to tokenized assets) to verify if a claim presented by
/// a user was issued by an entity trusted for that particular type of claim (claim topic).
/// Key features:
/// -   **Upgradeable:** Uses the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern, allowing the logic to be
///     updated without changing the contract address or losing data.
/// -   **Access Control:** Leverages `AccessControlUpgradeable` from OpenZeppelin. A `REGISTRAR_ROLE` is
///     defined, which grants permission to add, remove, and update trusted issuers and their claim topics.
///     The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` can manage who holds the `REGISTRAR_ROLE`.
/// -   **Efficient Lookups:** Maintains mappings to quickly find all trusted issuers for a given claim topic
///     (`_issuersByClaimTopic`) and to check if a specific issuer is trusted for a specific topic
///     (`_claimTopicIssuerIndex`).
/// -   **Meta-transactions:** Supports gasless transactions for users via `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable` if a trusted
///     forwarder is configured.
/// -   **ERC165:** Implements `supportsInterface` for discoverability of its `IERC3643TrustedIssuersRegistry`
/// compliance.
/// The contract stores `TrustedIssuer` structs, which link an issuer's address to an array of claim topics they are
/// authorized for. It also maintains an array of all registered issuer addresses (`_issuerAddresses`) for enumeration.
