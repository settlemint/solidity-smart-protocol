/// @title Centralized Access Control Manager for SMART Tokens (Upgradeable)
/// @notice This contract is a dedicated manager for handling roles and permissions across multiple
///         SMART token contracts. Instead of each token managing its own access control, they can
///         delegate these checks to an instance of this `SMARTTokenAccessManager`.
///         This promotes consistency, simplifies role management (as roles are managed in one place),
///         and can save gas by deploying this logic once and reusing it.
/// @dev This contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's `AccessControlUpgradeable` to get robust
///      role-based access control features (like granting, revoking, renouncing roles) and
///      `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable` to support meta-transactions.
///      It is designed to be upgradeable using a Transparent Proxy Pattern.
///      Meta-transactions allow users to interact with contracts without needing ETH for gas fees,
///      as a trusted "forwarder" can relay their transactions.
