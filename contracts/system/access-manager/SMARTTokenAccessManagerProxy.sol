/// @title SMART Token Access Manager Proxy Contract
/// @author SettleMint Tokenization Services
/// @notice This contract acts as an upgradeable proxy for the `SMARTTokenAccessManagerImplementation`.
/// @dev It follows the EIP-1967 standard for upgradeable proxies. This means that this contract (the proxy)
///      holds the storage and the public address that users interact with, while the logic (code execution)
///      is delegated to a separate implementation contract (`SMARTTokenAccessManagerImplementation`).
///      The address of the current implementation contract is retrieved dynamically from the `ISMARTSystem` contract.
///      This allows the underlying token access manager logic to be upgraded without changing the proxy's address or
/// losing its state.
///      Inherits from `SMARTSystemProxy`.

    /// 1. Stores the `systemAddress` (handled by `SMARTSystemProxy` constructor).
    /// 2. Retrieves the initial `SMARTTokenAccessManagerImplementation` address from the `ISMARTSystem` contract.
    /// 3. Ensures this retrieved implementation address is not the zero address.
    /// 4. Executes a `delegatecall` to the `initialize` function of the `SMARTTokenAccessManagerImplementation`
    /// contract
    ///    via `_performInitializationDelegatecall`.
