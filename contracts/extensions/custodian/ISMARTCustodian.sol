/// @notice Defines the external functions exposed by a SMART Custodian extension.
/// @dev This interface outlines the capabilities for managing token custody, including freezing assets,
///      performing forced transfers, and recovering assets from lost wallets. Implementations of this
///      interface are expected to handle necessary authorization checks for these sensitive operations.
///      A Solidity 'interface' is like a contract blueprint that only declares functions without implementing
///      them. Other contracts can then be written to implement this interface, guaranteeing they provide
///      these functions. This promotes interoperability and standardized interactions.
