/// @title Standard (Non-Upgradeable) SMART Custodian Extension
/// @notice This abstract contract provides the non-upgradeable implementation of custodian features
///         (like freezing, forced transfers, recovery) for a SMART token.
/// @dev It integrates the core logic from `_SMARTCustodianLogic` with a standard ERC20 token.
///      This contract is 'abstract' because it expects the final, deployable token contract to:
///      1. Inherit a full ERC20 implementation (which provides `balanceOf` and `_update`).
///      2. Inherit the main `SMART` token contract (which provides core SMART functionalities and hooks).
///      3. Inherit an authorization mechanism (e.g., `SMARTCustodianAccessControlAuthorization` or a custom one)
///         to control access to the sensitive custodian functions exposed by `_SMARTCustodianLogic`.
///      The constructor calls `__SMARTCustodian_init_unchained()` to register the custodian interface.
///      It implements the abstract functions `__custodian_getBalance` and `__custodian_executeTransferUpdate`
///      from `_SMARTCustodianLogic` using standard `ERC20.balanceOf` and `ERC20._update` respectively.
///      It also overrides `SMARTHooks` (`_beforeMint`, `_beforeTransfer`, etc.) to inject custodian-specific
///      checks (e.g., preventing transfers involving frozen addresses) by calling the corresponding
///      `__custodian_...Logic` helper functions from `_SMARTCustodianLogic` and then `super.hook()`
///      to maintain the hook chain.
