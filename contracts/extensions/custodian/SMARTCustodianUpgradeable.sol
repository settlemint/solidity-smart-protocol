/// @title Upgradeable SMART Custodian Extension
/// @notice This abstract contract provides the upgradeable (UUPS proxy pattern) implementation of custodian
///         features (like freezing, forced transfers, recovery) for a SMART token.
/// @dev It integrates the core logic from `_SMARTCustodianLogic` with an `ERC20Upgradeable` token.
///      This contract is 'abstract' because the final, deployable (and upgradeable) token contract must:
///      1. Inherit `UUPSUpgradeable` (from OpenZeppelin) and implement `_authorizeUpgrade` to control upgrades.
///      2. Inherit a full `ERC20Upgradeable` implementation.
///      3. Inherit the main `SMARTUpgradeable` token contract.
///      4. Inherit an authorization mechanism (e.g., an upgradeable version of
///         `SMARTCustodianAccessControlAuthorization`) to control access to custodian functions.
///      It uses `Initializable` for managing the initialization process suitable for proxies.
///      The `__SMARTCustodian_init` function serves as its initializer, calling `__SMARTCustodian_init_unchained`.
///      It implements `__custodian_getBalance` and `__custodian_executeTransferUpdate` using
///      `ERC20Upgradeable.balanceOf` and `ERC20Upgradeable._update` respectively.
///      It overrides `SMARTHooks` to inject custodian checks, similar to its non-upgradeable counterpart.
