/// @title Standard (Non-Upgradeable) SMART Pausable Extension
/// @notice This abstract contract provides the non-upgradeable implementation of pausable functionality
///         for a SMART token. It allows core token operations (transfers, mints, burns) to be halted.
/// @dev It integrates the pausable logic from `_SMARTPausableLogic` (which includes the `_paused` state
///      variable and `whenNotPaused` modifier) with a standard `ERC20` token.
///      This is achieved by overriding the `ERC20._update` function and applying the `whenNotPaused`
///      modifier to it. Since `_update` is the internal function used by `_transfer`, `_mint`, and `_burn`
///      in OpenZeppelin's ERC20, this effectively pauses all standard token movements.
///      This contract is 'abstract' and is intended to be inherited by a final, deployable, non-upgradeable
///      SMART token. The final token would also inherit a full `ERC20` implementation (like `SMART.sol`),
///      the main `SMART.sol` logic itself, and an authorization mechanism (e.g.,
///      `SMARTPausableAccessControlAuthorization.sol`) to control who can call `pause` and `unpause`.
///      The constructor calls `__SMARTPausable_init_unchained()` to register the pausable interface.

     *      (i.e., `_transfer`, `_mint`, `_burn` in OpenZeppelin ERC20) are effectively paused when the
     *      contract is in a paused state.
     *      It then calls `super._update` to delegate the actual token ledger update to the next contract
     *      in the inheritance chain (which is typically `SMART.sol` or the base `ERC20.sol` if `SMART.sol`
     *      itself calls super in its own `_update` override).

     * @param to The address to which tokens are being sent (or `address(0)` for burns).
