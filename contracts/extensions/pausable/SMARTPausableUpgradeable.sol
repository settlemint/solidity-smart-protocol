/// @title Upgradeable SMART Pausable Extension
/// @notice This abstract contract provides the upgradeable (UUPS proxy pattern) implementation of pausable
///         functionality for a SMART token.
/// @dev It integrates the pausable logic from `_SMARTPausableLogic` with an `ERC20Upgradeable` token.
///      Similar to its non-upgradeable counterpart (`SMARTPausable.sol`), this is achieved by overriding
///      the `ERC20Upgradeable._update` function and applying the `whenNotPaused` modifier from
///      `_SMARTPausableLogic`. This halts standard token movements (transfers, mints, burns) when paused.
///      This contract is 'abstract' and intended for inheritance by a final, deployable, upgradeable SMART token.
///      The final token contract would also inherit `ERC20Upgradeable`, `SMARTUpgradeable`, `UUPSUpgradeable`,
///      and an upgradeable authorization mechanism for pause/unpause controls.
///      It includes an `__SMARTPausable_init` initializer that calls the unchained initializer from the logic
///      contract to register the pausable interface for ERC165.

    // 2. `UUPSUpgradeable` for the upgrade mechanism and implement `_authorizeUpgrade`.
    // 3. An upgradeable authorization contract (e.g., an upgradeable version of
    //    `SMARTPausableAccessControlAuthorization.sol`) to manage who can pause/unpause.
    // In the final contract's `initialize` function, ensure `__SMARTPausable_init()` is called after other
    // essential initializers like `__ERC20_init`, `__Ownable_init` (or `__AccessControl_init`), and `__SMART_init`.

    ///      the proxy setup or a reinitialization phase if allowed by the upgrade pattern.
    ///      It calls `__SMARTPausable_init_unchained` from `_SMARTPausableLogic` to perform essential setup,
    ///      primarily registering the `ISMARTPausable` interface ID for ERC165 introspection.
    ///      Note: OpenZeppelin's `PausableUpgradeable` itself doesn't have an explicit initializer; its state
    ///      (`_paused`) is managed directly by its `_pause()` and `_unpause()` internal functions. This custom
    ///      `__SMARTPausable_init` is mainly for our framework's ERC165 registration consistency.

     * @notice Overrides the base `ERC20Upgradeable._update` function to integrate pausable functionality.

     *      token operations (mints, burns, standard transfers) via `_update` can only occur when the contract
     *      is not paused.
     *      Delegates the actual ledger update logic to `super._update`, which would call the next `_update`
     *      in the inheritance chain (e.g., `SMARTUpgradeable`'s `_update`).
     * @param from The address from which tokens are being sent (or `address(0)` for mints).
