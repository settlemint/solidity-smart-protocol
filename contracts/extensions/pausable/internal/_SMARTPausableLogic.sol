///         operations, event emissions, and modifiers (`whenNotPaused`, `whenPaused`) related to pausable
///         functionality.
/// @dev It is designed to be inherited by both standard (`SMARTPausable.sol`) and upgradeable
///      (`SMARTPausableUpgradeable.sol`) concrete pausable extension implementations. This ensures consistent
///      behavior for pausing and unpausing the token's core operations (like transfers).
///      An 'abstract contract' provides a template or partial implementation and cannot be deployed directly.
///      It relies on inheriting contracts to provide any further concrete implementations or connect to authorization
///      mechanisms.
///      The actual `pause()` and `unpause()` external functions that users/admins call are expected to be in
///      the concrete inheriting contracts, which would then call `_smart_pause()` and `_smart_unpause()`
///      internally after performing necessary authorization checks.
