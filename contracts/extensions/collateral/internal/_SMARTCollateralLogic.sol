/// @notice This abstract contract encapsulates the core, shared logic for verifying a global collateral
///         claim on the token contract's own OnchainID identity before allowing token minting.
///         It is not meant for direct deployment but serves as a base for both standard (`SMARTCollateral`)
///         and upgradeable (`SMARTCollateralUpgradeable`) collateral extensions.
/// @dev It provides the `findValidCollateralClaim` function to locate and validate the collateral claim,
///      and the `__collateral_beforeMintLogic` hook that uses this function to enforce the collateral requirement.
///      This contract expects inheriting contracts (or the final token contract) to provide implementations for:
///      - `this.identityRegistry()`: To get the `ISMARTIdentityRegistry`.
///      - `this.onchainID()`: To get the address of the token contract's own `IIdentity` contract.
///      - `this.totalSupply()`: To get the current total supply of the token.
///      The collateral proof topic ID is stored and used to filter relevant claims.
