/// @title Upgradeable SMART Collateral Extension
/// @notice This contract adds a collateral verification requirement to an upgradeable SMART token.
///         Before new tokens can be minted, it checks for a valid collateral claim on the token
///         contract's own OnchainID identity.
///         'Upgradeable' means the contract's logic can be changed post-deployment via a proxy,
///         without altering the contract's address.
/// @dev This `abstract contract` must be inherited by a concrete upgradeable token contract.
///      It uses `Initializable` for managing initialization in an upgradeable proxy context.
///      It inherits core logic from `_SMARTCollateralLogic` and common features from `SMARTExtensionUpgradeable`.
///      The final token contract must also inherit:
///      1. An upgradeable ERC20 (e.g., `ERC20Upgradeable`) for `totalSupply()`.
///      2. The core upgradeable SMART contract (e.g., `SMARTUpgradeable`) for `onchainID()` and `identityRegistry()`.
///      3. `SMARTHooks` (or `SMARTHooksUpgradeable`) for the `_beforeMint` hook mechanism.
///      Careful attention to storage layout is crucial when working with upgradeable contracts to avoid
///      storage slot collisions during upgrades.

    ///      If the check fails, `__collateral_beforeMintLogic` will revert the transaction.

    ///      in the inheritance chain. This is crucial for composability with other extensions.
    /// @param to The address that will receive the minted tokens (not directly used by this collateral check,
