/// @title Internal Logic for SMART Burnable Extension
/// @notice This abstract contract encapsulates the core, shared logic for token burning operations
///         within the SMART framework. It is not meant to be deployed directly but serves as a base
///         for both standard (`SMARTBurnable`) and upgradeable (`SMARTBurnableUpgradeable`) burnable extensions.
///         It defines the common structure for burn functions and an event, while delegating the actual
///         token destruction to an abstract hook.
/// @dev This contract provides the public `burn` and `batchBurn` functions (as defined in `ISMARTBurnable`)
///      by calling internal `_smart_burn` and `_smart_batchBurn` helpers. These helpers, in turn,
///      rely on an abstract function `__burnable_executeBurn` which must be implemented by concrete
///      inheriting contracts (like `SMARTBurnable` or `SMARTBurnableUpgradeable`). This pattern separates
///      the general logic from the specific ERC20 implementation details.
///      It also handles the emission of the `BurnCompleted` event.
