/// @title Upgradeable SMART Burnable Extension
/// @notice This contract provides the functionality to burn (destroy) tokens for a SMART token contract
///         that is designed to be upgradeable (e.g., using a proxy pattern).
///         'Upgradeable' contracts allow their logic to be updated after deployment without changing
///         the contract's address. This is useful for fixing bugs or adding new features.
/// @dev This abstract contract inherits from `Initializable` (to manage initialization in an upgradeable context),
///      `SMARTExtensionUpgradeable` (for common SMART upgradeable functionalities), and `_SMARTBurnableLogic`
///      (for the core burn operations).
///      Its main role is to implement the `__burnable_executeBurn` internal hook, specific to an upgradeable
///      ERC20 token standard (e.g., OpenZeppelin's `ERC20Upgradeable.sol`).
///      The final contract inheriting `SMARTBurnableUpgradeable` must also inherit an upgradeable ERC20 contract
///      that provides the internal `_burn(address from, uint256 amount)` function.
///      An 'abstract contract' can define some functions but might leave others for inheriting contracts to implement.
///      It cannot be deployed directly.
