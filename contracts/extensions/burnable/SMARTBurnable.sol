/// @title Standard (Non-Upgradeable) SMART Burnable Extension
/// @notice This contract provides the functionality to burn (destroy) tokens for a standard,
///         non-upgradeable SMART token contract. It acts as a concrete implementation layer
///         over the core burning logic defined in `_SMARTBurnableLogic`.
///         'Non-upgradeable' means the contract's code cannot be changed after it's deployed to the blockchain.
/// @dev This abstract contract inherits from `SMARTExtension` (for common SMART functionalities)
///      and `_SMARTBurnableLogic` (for the core burn operations).
///      Its primary responsibility is to implement the `__burnable_executeBurn` internal hook.
///      This hook is called by `_SMARTBurnableLogic` to perform the actual token destruction.
///      This implementation assumes that the final contract inheriting `SMARTBurnable` will also
///      inherit a standard ERC20 contract (like OpenZeppelin's `ERC20.sol`) which provides
///      the necessary internal `_burn(address from, uint256 amount)` function.
///      An 'abstract contract' can define some functions but might leave others for inheriting contracts to implement.
///      It cannot be deployed directly.
