/// @title Interface for the SMART Token Access Control Manager
/// @notice This interface defines the essential functions that a dedicated Access Control Manager
///         contract must implement for the SMART token ecosystem. SMART token contracts
///         that are "access managed" will delegate their authorization checks to a contract
///         that implements this interface.
///         In Solidity, an interface specifies function signatures (name, parameters, return types)
///         without providing the actual code (implementation). This allows different contracts
///         to interact with each other in a standardized way.
/// @dev This interface primarily focuses on the `hasRole` function, which is the core of
///      role-based access control. It also inherits from OpenZeppelin's `IAccessControl`
///      interface, which can be useful for broader compatibility, though `IAccessControl`
///      itself also primarily defines `hasRole` along with events and other role management functions
///      that are typically implemented by a full AccessControl contract, not just its interface.

    ///      the logic for storing and retrieving role assignments.
    /// @param role The `bytes32` identifier of the role in question (e.g., MINTER_ROLE, PAUSER_ROLE).
