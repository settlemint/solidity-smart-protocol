/// @title Internal Logic for SMART Token Access Management Extension
/// @notice This abstract contract encapsulates the core shared logic for managing access
///         control in SMART tokens. It handles the storage of the access manager's address
///         and provides internal functions for role checks and initialization.
///         Using an internal logic contract helps to avoid code duplication between
///         the standard and upgradeable versions of an extension and promotes modularity.
/// @dev This contract is not meant to be deployed directly but rather inherited by
///      `SMARTTokenAccessManaged` and `SMARTTokenAccessManagedUpgradeable` contracts.
///      It implements `ISMARTTokenAccessManaged` by delegating `hasRole` checks to the
///      configured `_accessManager`.
