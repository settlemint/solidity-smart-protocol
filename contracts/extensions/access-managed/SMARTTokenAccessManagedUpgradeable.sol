/// @title Abstract Contract for Upgradeable Access-Managed SMART Tokens
/// @notice This contract serves as a base for SMART token contracts that are designed to be
///         upgradeable (using a proxy pattern) and need to integrate with a centralized
///         `SMARTTokenAccessManager`. It provides the foundational functionality to link
///         a token to its access manager in an upgradeable context.
///         An 'abstract contract' in Solidity is a template that other contracts can inherit from.
///         It might not be fully implemented and cannot be deployed on its own.
///         'Upgradeable' contracts can have their logic changed after deployment without
///         changing the contract's address, which is useful for bug fixes or adding features.
/// @dev This is the upgradeable version. Inheriting contracts should call the
///      `__SMARTTokenAccessManaged_init` initializer function, passing the address of the
///      `SMARTTokenAccessManager`. They are also responsible for implementing any necessary
///      authorization hooks by delegating calls to the designated manager contract.
///      Delegation means this contract forwards certain checks to the `SMARTTokenAccessManager`.
///      The `Initializable` contract from OpenZeppelin helps manage initialization in upgradeable contracts,
///      ensuring that initialization logic runs only once.
