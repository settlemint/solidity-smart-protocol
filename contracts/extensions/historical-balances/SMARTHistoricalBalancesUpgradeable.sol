/// @title Upgradeable SMART Historical Balances Extension
/// @notice This abstract contract provides the upgradeable (UUPS proxy pattern) implementation for tracking
///         historical token balances and total supply for a SMART token.
/// @dev It integrates the core checkpointing logic from `_SMARTHistoricalBalancesLogic` into the upgradeable
///      SMART token lifecycle. This is done by overriding `SMARTHooks` (`_afterMint`, `_afterBurn`,
///      `_afterTransfer`) to call the corresponding internal logic functions from `_SMARTHistoricalBalancesLogic`.
///      This contract is 'abstract' and designed to be inherited by a final, deployable, upgradeable SMART token.
///      The final token contract would also inherit `ERC20Upgradeable`, the main `SMARTUpgradeable` contract,
///      and `UUPSUpgradeable` for managing upgrades.
///      It includes an `__SMARTHistoricalBalances_init` initializer function, which calls the unchained
///      initializer from the logic contract to register the interface for ERC165.
