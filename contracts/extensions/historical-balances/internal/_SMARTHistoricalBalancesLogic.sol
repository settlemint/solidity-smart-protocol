/// @title Internal Core Logic for SMART Historical Balances Extension
/// @notice This abstract contract provides the foundational mechanisms for tracking historical token balances
///         for individual accounts and the historical total supply of the token.
/// @dev It utilizes OpenZeppelin's `Checkpoints.Trace208` library to store and retrieve historical data points.
///      The contract defines how checkpoints are created after mint, burn, and transfer operations via internal
///      `__historical_balances_...Logic` functions, which are intended to be called by `SMARTHooks` in the
///      concrete implementations (`SMARTHistoricalBalances.sol` and `SMARTHistoricalBalancesUpgradeable.sol`).
///      An 'abstract contract' is a base contract that may have unimplemented parts and cannot be deployed directly.
///      It must be inherited by another contract that provides any missing implementations.
///      Key features:
///      - `_balanceCheckpoints`: Mapping to store `Checkpoints.Trace208` for each account.
///      - `_totalSupplyCheckpoints`: A single `Checkpoints.Trace208` for the token's total supply.
///      - `clock()`: Defines the time source for checkpoints (defaults to `block.timestamp`).
///      - `balanceOfAt()` and `totalSupplyAt()`: Public view functions to query historical data.
///      - `_writeCheckpointAdd()` and `_writeCheckpointSubtract()`: Internal helpers for updating checkpoints.
