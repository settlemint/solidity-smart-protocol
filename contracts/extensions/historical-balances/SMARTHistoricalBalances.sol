/// @dev It integrates the core checkpointing logic from `_SMARTHistoricalBalancesLogic` into the standard
///      (non-upgradeable) SMART token lifecycle. This is achieved by overriding the `SMARTHooks`
///      (`_afterMint`, `_afterBurn`, `_afterTransfer`) to call the corresponding internal logic functions

///      and the main `SMART.sol` (or equivalent).
