/// @title Interface for the SMART Yield Extension
/// @notice This interface defines the functions that a SMART Yield token extension must implement.
/// It allows for the management of a yield schedule associated with a token, which dictates how yield is accrued and
/// paid out.
/// This interface also inherits from `ISMARTHistoricalBalances`, indicating that any implementing contract
/// must also support querying token balances at historical points in time, a feature often crucial for accurate yield
/// calculations.
/// @dev This interface is intended to be implemented by contracts that provide yield-generating capabilities for
/// tokens.
/// The functions are external, allowing them to be called from other contracts or off-chain applications.

    /// When this event is emitted, it signifies that the `schedule` address is now the authoritative contract dictating
    /// the terms of yield for this token.
    /// The `indexed` keyword for `sender` and `schedule` allows for efficient searching and filtering of these events
    /// based
    /// on these addresses.
    /// For example, one could easily find all tokens for which a specific yield schedule was set, or all schedules set
    /// by a
    /// particular admin.
