/// @title Interface for the SMART Yield Extension
/// @notice This interface defines the functions that a SMART Yield token extension must implement.
/// It allows for the management of a yield schedule associated with a token, which dictates how yield is accrued and
/// paid out.
/// This interface also inherits from `ISMARTHistoricalBalances`, indicating that any implementing contract
/// must also support querying token balances at historical points in time, a feature often crucial for accurate yield
/// calculations.
/// @dev This interface is intended to be implemented by contracts that provide yield-generating capabilities for
/// tokens.
/// The functions are external, allowing them to be called from other contracts or off-chain applications.

    /// @notice Emitted when a new yield schedule is successfully set or updated for a token.
    /// @dev This event is critical for transparency and tracking changes to how a token generates and distributes yield.
    /// When this event is emitted, it signifies that the `schedule` address is now the authoritative contract dictating
    /// the terms of yield for this token.
    /// The `indexed` keyword for `sender` and `schedule` allows for efficient searching and filtering of these events based
    /// on these addresses.
    /// For example, one could easily find all tokens for which a specific yield schedule was set, or all schedules set by a
    /// particular admin.
    /// @param sender The address of the account (e.g., an admin or owner) that initiated the transaction to set the yield

    /// - For a bond-like token, this might be its face value (e.g., 100 USD).
    /// - For an equity-like token, it might be its nominal value or a value derived from an oracle.
    /// This function allows the basis to be specific to a `holder`, enabling scenarios where different holders might
    /// have different
    /// yield bases (though often it will be a global value, in which case `holder` might be ignored).

    /// 10000).

    /// holder-specific configurations.
