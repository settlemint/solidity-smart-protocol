/// @title Internal Logic for the SMART Yield Extension
/// @notice This abstract contract provides the core, reusable logic for managing yield schedules associated with a
/// SMART token.
/// It handles setting a yield schedule and includes a hook for `_beforeMint` to potentially restrict minting once a
/// schedule is active.
/// @dev This contract is designed to be inherited by other contracts (either standard or upgradeable versions of the
/// yield extension)
/// that will integrate this logic into a full token implementation.
/// It implements the `ISMARTYield` interface (partially, as some functions like `yieldBasisPerUnit`, `yieldToken` are
/// expected to be overridden or implemented by the final contract).
/// Key functionalities:
/// - Storing the address of the `yieldSchedule` contract.
/// - Providing an internal function `_smart_setYieldSchedule` to set this schedule with necessary checks.
/// - Registering the `ISMARTYield` interface for ERC165 discovery.
/// - Implementing a `__yield_beforeMintLogic` hook that reverts if minting is attempted while a yield schedule is
/// active and its start date has passed.
/// The `abstract` keyword means this contract itself cannot be deployed directly.

    /// @dev This state variable stores the address of the external contract (implementing `ISMARTYieldSchedule`)
    /// that dictates how yield is calculated, accrued, and distributed. It is set via `_smart_setYieldSchedule`.
    /// If it's the zero address (`address(0)`), it means no yield schedule is currently associated with the token.
    /// It is `public`, so a getter function `yieldSchedule()` is automatically created by the compiler, allowing anyone
    /// to query this address.

    /// `_SMARTExtension`).

    /// 1. Ensures the provided `schedule` address is not the zero address (using `ZeroAddressNotAllowed` error).
    /// 2. Ensures that a `yieldSchedule` is not already set (using `YieldScheduleAlreadySet` error). This prevents
    /// overwriting an existing schedule inadvertently.
    /// If these checks pass, it updates the `yieldSchedule` state variable with the new `schedule` address and emits a
    /// `YieldScheduleSet` event.
    /// This function is `internal`, meaning it can only be called by the contract itself or by derived contracts.
    /// Access control (who can call this) should be implemented in the contract that exposes this functionality
    /// publicly (e.g., via a public `setYieldSchedule` function).

    /// contract must implement `ISMARTYieldSchedule`.

    /// yield schedule.
    /// @dev This function is designed to be called within a `_beforeMint` hook of the main token contract.
    /// Its purpose is to enforce rules related to minting once a yield schedule is active.
    /// If a `yieldSchedule` has been set (is not `address(0)`):
    /// 1. It checks the `startDate()` of the `yieldSchedule` contract (by calling it via the `ISMARTYieldSchedule`
    /// interface).
    /// 2. If the schedule's `startDate()` is less than or equal to the current `block.timestamp` (meaning the schedule
    /// has started or is in the past),
    ///    it reverts the transaction with a `YieldScheduleActive` error. This can prevent new tokens from being minted
    /// after yield distribution has begun,
    ///    which might be important for the fairness or mechanics of certain yield models.
    /// This function is `internal view virtual`, meaning it doesn't change state, can be called by derived contracts,
    /// and can be overridden.
