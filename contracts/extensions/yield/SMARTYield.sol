/// @title Standard SMART Yield Extension (Non-Upgradeable)
/// @notice This contract provides a standard, non-upgradeable implementation for the SMART Yield extension.
/// It allows a token to have an associated yield schedule, dictating how yield is accrued and potentially paid out.
/// @dev This is an `abstract` contract, meaning it is not meant to be deployed directly but rather inherited by a
/// final, concrete token contract.
/// It inherits from:
/// - `Context`: Provides access to `_msgSender()`, identifying the caller of a function.
/// - `SMARTExtension`: Provides common functionalities for SMART extensions (e.g., ERC165 interface registration via
/// `_SMARTYieldLogic`).
/// - `_SMARTYieldLogic`: Contains the core logic for managing the `yieldSchedule` address and the `_beforeMint` hook
/// logic.
/// This contract primarily serves to integrate the `_SMARTYieldLogic` into a non-upgradeable token structure.
/// It overrides the `_beforeMint` hook from `SMARTHooks` to include the yield-specific minting condition from
/// `__yield_beforeMintLogic`.
/// The final concrete token contract is expected to also inherit a standard ERC20 implementation and the core
/// `SMART.sol` logic.
/// It must also provide implementations for other `ISMARTYield` functions like `setYieldSchedule`, `yieldBasisPerUnit`,
/// `yieldToken`, and `canManageYield`,
/// typically by exposing `_smart_setYieldSchedule` with appropriate access control and defining the other view
/// functions.

    /// It first executes the `__yield_beforeMintLogic()` from `_SMARTYieldLogic`.
    /// This logic checks if a yield schedule is active and, if so, might prevent minting (reverting with
    /// `YieldScheduleActive`).
    /// After executing the yield-specific logic, it calls `super._beforeMint(to, amount)` to ensure that any
    /// `_beforeMint` hooks
    /// from other parent contracts in the inheritance chain are also executed. This maintains the composability of
    /// hooks.
