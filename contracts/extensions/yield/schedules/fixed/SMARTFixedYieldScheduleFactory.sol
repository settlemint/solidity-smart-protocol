/// @title Factory for Creating SMARTFixedYieldSchedule Contracts
/// @notice This contract serves as a factory to deploy new instances of `SMARTFixedYieldSchedule` contracts.
/// It allows for the creation of these yield schedules with deterministic addresses using the CREATE2 opcode,
/// if a unique salt is derived from the schedule parameters.
/// @dev Key features of this factory:
/// - **Deployment of Schedules**: Provides a `create` function to deploy new `SMARTFixedYieldSchedule` instances.
/// - **CREATE2**: Leverages `CREATE2` for deploying schedules, allowing their addresses to be pre-calculated if the
/// salt (derived from creation parameters) is known.
/// - **Authorization**: The `create` function checks if the caller (`_msgSender()`) is authorized to manage yield on
/// the target `token` (via `token.canManageYield()`).
/// - **Registry**: Maintains an array `allSchedules` to keep track of all yield schedule contracts created by this
/// factory.
/// - **Meta-transactions**: Inherits `ERC2771Context` to support gasless schedule creation if a trusted forwarder is
/// configured.
/// This factory simplifies the deployment process for fixed yield schedules and ensures that only authorized parties
/// can set them up for a given token.
/// @custom:security-contact support@settlemint.com Ensure the `trustedForwarder` is correctly configured if
/// meta-transactions are used.

    /// @notice Creates and deploys a new `SMARTFixedYieldSchedule` contract for a given SMART token.

    /// 1. **Authorization Check**: Verifies that the caller (`_msgSender()`) has permission to manage yield for the
    /// target `token` by calling `token.canManageYield(_msgSender())`. If not, it reverts with `NotAuthorized`.
    /// 2. **Salt Generation**: Computes a unique `salt` for the CREATE2 opcode. The salt is derived from the `token`
    /// address and all the schedule parameters (`startTime`, `endTime`, `rate`, `interval`). This ensures that
    /// deploying a schedule with the exact same parameters for the same token will result in the same contract address
    /// (if deployed via this factory and salt scheme).
    /// 3. **Deployment**: Deploys a new `SMARTFixedYieldSchedule` contract using the `new SMARTFixedYieldSchedule{salt:
    /// salt}(...)` syntax (CREATE2).
    ///    The `initialOwner` of the new schedule contract is set to the `_msgSender()` (the creator).
    ///    The `trustedForwarder()` of this factory is passed to the new schedule for its own ERC2771 context.
    /// 4. **Event Emission**: Emits a `SMARTFixedYieldScheduleCreated` event with the address of the new schedule and
    /// the creator's address.
    /// 5. **Registry Update**: Adds the new schedule contract's address (cast to `ISMARTFixedYieldSchedule`) to the
    /// `allSchedules` array.
    /// Note: The line `token.setYieldSchedule(scheduleAddress)` is commented out. This implies that setting the
    /// schedule on the token itself is a separate step, to be performed by an authorized party after the schedule
    /// contract is deployed. This separation can be useful for operational workflows or if `setYieldSchedule` has its
    /// own complex authorization that shouldn't be mixed here.
