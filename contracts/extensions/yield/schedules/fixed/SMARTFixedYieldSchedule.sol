/// @title SMART Fixed Yield Schedule Contract
/// @notice This contract implements a fixed yield schedule for an associated SMART token (which must implement
/// `ISMARTYield`).
/// It allows token holders to accrue yield at a predetermined fixed `rate` over specified `interval`s between a
/// `startDate` and `endDate`.
/// Yield is paid out in an `underlyingAsset` (which can be the token itself or another ERC20 token).
/// @dev This contract manages the entire lifecycle of a fixed yield distribution:
/// - **Configuration**: `startDate`, `endDate`, `rate`, `interval`, and the `token` it serves.
/// - **Period Management**: Calculates and uses period end timestamps for yield accrual.
/// - **Yield Calculation**: Leverages `balanceOfAt` and `yieldBasisPerUnit` from the `ISMARTYield` token to determine
/// yield per period for each holder.
/// - **Claiming**: Token holders can call `claimYield()` to receive their accrued yield.
/// - **Funding**: The contract can be topped up with the `underlyingAsset` via `topUpUnderlyingAsset()` to ensure
/// payouts can be made.
/// - **Administration**: Includes `AccessControl` for owner-restricted functions like `withdrawUnderlyingAsset` and
/// `pause()`/`unpause()`.
/// - **Meta-transactions**: Inherits `ERC2771Context` to support gasless transactions if a trusted forwarder is
/// configured.
/// - **Security**: Uses `ReentrancyGuard` to protect against reentrancy attacks on state-changing functions like
/// `claimYield`.
/// It implements the `ISMARTFixedYieldSchedule` interface.
/// @custom:security-contact support@settlemint.com Ensure to review security practices for deploying and managing this
/// contract.
