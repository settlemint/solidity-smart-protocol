/// @title Upgradeable SMART Yield Extension
/// @notice This contract provides an upgradeable implementation for the SMART Yield extension.
/// It allows a token to have an associated yield schedule. Being "upgradeable" means its logic
/// can be updated after deployment via a proxy pattern.
/// @dev This is an `abstract` contract, designed to be inherited by a final, concrete upgradeable token contract.
/// It inherits from:
/// - `ContextUpgradeable`: Provides `_msgSender()` in an upgradeable context.
/// - `SMARTExtensionUpgradeable`: Provides common functionalities for SMART extensions in an upgradeable context (e.g.,
/// ERC165 registration).
/// - `_SMARTYieldLogic`: Contains the core logic for managing `yieldSchedule` and the `_beforeMint` hook logic.
/// It also implicitly requires `Initializable` for its own `__SMARTYield_init` function.
/// This contract integrates `_SMARTYieldLogic` into an upgradeable token structure.
/// It overrides the `_beforeMint` hook (expected to be available from an inherited `SMARTUpgradeable` or similar base
/// that includes `SMARTHooks`)
/// to include the yield-specific minting condition from `__yield_beforeMintLogic`.
/// The final concrete token is expected to inherit `ERC20Upgradeable`, `SMARTUpgradeable`, and call
/// `__SMARTYield_init()` in its main initializer.
/// It must also implement other `ISMARTYield` functions.

    /// upgradeable token contract that inherits `SMARTYieldUpgradeable`.
    /// The `onlyInitializing` modifier (from OpenZeppelin's `Initializable`) ensures this function can only be called
    /// during the contract's initialization phase, preventing re-initialization.
    /// It calls `__SMARTYield_init_unchained()` from the inherited `_SMARTYieldLogic` contract.

    // -- Hooks (Overrides) --

    /// @notice Overrides the `_beforeMint` hook to incorporate yield-specific logic in an upgradeable context.
    /// @dev This function is called internally before any tokens are minted. It assumes that the base upgradeable
    /// token contract (e.g., `SMARTUpgradeable`) provides a virtual `_beforeMint` hook by inheriting `SMARTHooks`.
    /// It first executes `__yield_beforeMintLogic()` from `_SMARTYieldLogic`.
    /// This logic checks if a yield schedule is active and might prevent minting (reverting with
    /// `YieldScheduleActive`).
    /// After the yield-specific check, it calls `super._beforeMint(to, amount)` to ensure that `_beforeMint` hooks
    /// from other parent contracts in the inheritance chain (like `SMARTHooks` itself or other extensions) are also
    /// executed.
    /// `internal virtual override(SMARTHooks)` indicates it's internal, can be further overridden,
    /// and specifically overrides `_beforeMint` from a contract in the hierarchy that provides `SMARTHooks` (e.g.,
    /// `SMARTUpgradeable`).
    /// @inheritdoc SMARTHooks
    /// @param to The address that will receive the minted tokens.
    /// @param amount The quantity of tokens to be minted.
    function _beforeMint(address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override(SMARTHooks) {
