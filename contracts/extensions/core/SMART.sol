/// @title Standard (Non-Upgradeable) SMART Token Implementation
/// @notice This abstract contract provides a concrete, non-upgradeable implementation of a SMART token.
///         It combines standard ERC20 functionality with the core SMART features like identity verification
///         and compliance checks, managed through the `_SMARTLogic` base contract.
/// @dev This contract is 'abstract' because it expects an accompanying authorization contract
///      (e.g., one implementing role-based access control for permissioned functions like minting or
///      updating settings) to be inherited by the final, deployable token contract.
///      It inherits from:
///      - `SMARTExtension`: Provides base SMART functionalities and context (like `_smartSender`).
///      - `_SMARTLogic`: Contains the core state variables and internal logic for SMART features.
///      - `ERC20`: OpenZeppelin's standard ERC20 token implementation.
///      - `ERC165`: OpenZeppelin's utility for ERC165 interface detection.
///      The constructor initializes both the ERC20 part (name, symbol) and the SMART logic part
///      (decimals, identity registry, compliance settings, etc.) via `__SMART_init_unchained`.
///      It overrides key ERC20 functions and hooks (`transfer`, `_update`, `_beforeMint`, etc.)
///      to integrate the SMART compliance and verification logic.

    ///      functionalities, including setting `decimals_`, `onchainID_`, linking the `identityRegistry_` and
    ///      `compliance_` contracts, and configuring `requiredClaimTopics_` and `initialModulePairs_`.
    ///      The `payable` keyword here is a common Solidity pattern for constructors, even if this specific
