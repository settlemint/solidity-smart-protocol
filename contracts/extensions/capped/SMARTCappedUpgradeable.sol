/// @title Upgradeable SMART Capped Token Extension
/// @notice This contract adds a maximum total supply (a "cap") to an upgradeable SMART token.
///         Once the total supply reaches this cap, no more tokens can be minted.
///         'Upgradeable' contracts can have their logic updated after deployment without changing their address,
///         which is useful for bug fixes or adding new features.
/// @dev This is an `abstract contract` and cannot be deployed directly. It must be inherited.
///      It inherits from `Initializable` (for managing initialization in upgradeable contracts),
///      `SMARTExtensionUpgradeable` (for common SMART upgradeable features), and the core capping
///      logic from `_SMARTCappedLogic`.
///      To function correctly, the final token contract using `SMARTCappedUpgradeable` must also inherit:
///      1. An upgradeable ERC20 implementation (e.g., OpenZeppelin's `ERC20Upgradeable.sol`), which provides
/// `totalSupply()`.
///      2. `SMARTHooks` (or `SMARTHooksUpgradeable` if preferred and available), which provides the `_beforeMint` hook.
///      The capping check is enforced by overriding the `_beforeMint` hook from `SMARTHooks`.
