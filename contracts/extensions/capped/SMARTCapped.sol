/// @notice This contract adds a maximum total supply (a "cap") to a standard, non-upgradeable
///         SMART token. Once the total supply reaches this cap, no more tokens can be minted.
///         'Non-upgradeable' means the contract's code cannot be changed after deployment.
/// @dev This is an `abstract contract`, meaning it provides some implementations but might rely
///      on other contracts (that inherit it) to provide further details. It cannot be deployed directly.
///      It inherits the core capping logic from `_SMARTCappedLogic`.
///      To function correctly, the final token contract that uses `SMARTCapped` must also inherit:
///      1. A standard ERC20 implementation (e.g., OpenZeppelin's `ERC20.sol`), which provides the `totalSupply()`
/// function.
///      2. `SMARTHooks` (from the SMART framework), which provides the `_beforeMint` hook mechanism.
///      The capping check is enforced by overriding the `_beforeMint` hook. Before any tokens are minted,
///      this extension will verify that the new total supply will not exceed the defined cap.
