/// @title Internal Logic for SMART Capped Token Extension
/// @notice This abstract contract provides the core, shared logic and storage for implementing
///         a maximum total supply (cap) on a SMART token. It is not intended for direct deployment
///         but serves as a base for `SMARTCapped.sol` (non-upgradeable) and
///         `SMARTCappedUpgradeable.sol` (upgradeable) extensions.
/// @dev This contract stores the `_cap` value and contains the fundamental logic for checking
///      against this cap (`__capped_beforeMintLogic`). It defines an abstract function
///      `__capped_totalSupply()` which must be implemented by inheriting contracts to provide
///      the current total supply (usually by delegating to an underlying ERC20 implementation).
///      It implements the `ISMARTCapped` interface by providing a public `cap()` view function.
