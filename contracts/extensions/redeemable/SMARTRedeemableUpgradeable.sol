/// @title Upgradeable SMART Redeemable Extension
/// @notice This contract provides an upgradeable implementation for the redeemable token functionality.
/// It allows token holders to redeem (burn) their own tokens. Being "upgradeable" means its logic
/// can be updated after deployment through a proxy pattern (e.g., UUPS or Transparent Upgradeable Proxy).
/// @dev This is an `abstract` contract, intended to be inherited by a final, concrete upgradeable token contract.
/// It inherits from:
/// - `Initializable`: Manages initialization for upgradeable contracts, ensuring `initialize` functions are called only
/// once.
/// - `ContextUpgradeable`: Provides access to `_msgSender()` in an upgradeable context.
/// - `SMARTExtensionUpgradeable`: Provides common functionalities for SMART extensions in an upgradeable context.
/// - `_SMARTRedeemableLogic`: Contains the core logic for redeeming tokens (e.g., `redeem`, `redeemAll` functions,
/// hooks, event emission).
/// This contract implements the abstract functions `__redeemable_getBalance` and `__redeemable_redeem` from
/// `_SMARTRedeemableLogic`,
/// adapting them for an upgradeable ERC20 context (e.g., `ERC20Upgradeable`).
/// It assumes the final concrete contract will also inherit an upgradeable ERC20 implementation (like
/// `ERC20Upgradeable` along with `ERC20BurnableUpgradeable`).
