/// @title Interface for the SMART Redeemable Extension
/// @notice This interface defines the functions that a SMART Redeemable token extension must implement.
/// It allows token holders to redeem (burn) their own tokens, effectively reducing the total supply.
/// @dev This interface is intended to be implemented by contracts that provide redeemable token functionality.
/// The functions defined here are external, meaning they can be called from outside the contract.

    /// @notice Emitted when tokens are successfully redeemed (burned by the token holder).
    /// @dev This event is crucial for tracking the reduction of token supply due to redemptions.
    /// It signifies that a token holder has voluntarily exchanged their tokens to have them permanently removed from
    /// circulation.
    /// Off-chain services can listen to this event to update balances, statistics, or trigger other processes.
    /// The `indexed` keyword for `sender` allows for efficient searching and filtering of these events based on the
    /// sender's address.
    /// @param sender The address of the token holder who redeemed their tokens. This address initiated the redeem
    /// transaction.
    /// @param amount The quantity of tokens that were redeemed and thus burned. This is the amount by which the
    /// sender's
    /// balance and the total supply decreased.
