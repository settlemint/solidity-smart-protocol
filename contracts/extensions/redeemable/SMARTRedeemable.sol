/// @title Standard SMART Redeemable Extension (Non-Upgradeable)
/// @notice This contract provides a standard, non-upgradeable implementation for the redeemable token functionality.
/// It allows token holders to redeem (burn) their own tokens.
/// @dev This is an `abstract` contract, meaning it's not meant to be deployed directly but rather inherited by a final,
/// concrete token contract.
/// It inherits from:
/// - `Context`: Provides access to `_msgSender()`, which identifies the caller of a function.
/// - `SMARTExtension`: Provides common functionalities for SMART extensions, like ERC165 interface registration.
/// - `_SMARTRedeemableLogic`: Contains the core logic for redeeming tokens (e.g., `redeem`, `redeemAll` functions,
/// hooks, event emission).
/// This contract specifically implements the abstract functions `__redeemable_getBalance` and `__redeemable_redeem`
/// that were defined in `_SMARTRedeemableLogic`.
/// It assumes that the final concrete contract will also inherit a standard ERC20 implementation (like OpenZeppelin's
/// `ERC20.sol` or `ERC20Burnable.sol`)
/// which provides the `balanceOf(address)` and internal `_burn(address, uint256)` functions.
