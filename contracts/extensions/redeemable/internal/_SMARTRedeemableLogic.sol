/// @title Internal Logic for SMART Redeemable Extension
/// @notice This abstract contract provides the core, reusable logic for the redeemable token functionality.
/// It allows token holders to burn (redeem) their own tokens.
/// @dev This contract is designed to be inherited by other contracts (either standard or upgradeable versions
/// of the redeemable extension) that will provide the full implementation details (like how `_burn` works or
/// how context like `_smartSender` is obtained).
/// It implements the `ISMARTRedeemable` interface.
/// The `abstract` keyword means this contract itself cannot be deployed directly; it must be inherited.
/// It uses `_SMARTExtension` for common extension functionalities like interface registration (ERC165).
/// Key functionalities include:
/// - Registering the `ISMARTRedeemable` interface for discovery.
/// - Defining `redeem` and `redeemAll` functions as specified in `ISMARTRedeemable`.
/// - Introducing abstract functions `__redeemable_getBalance` and `__redeemable_redeem` which must be implemented by
/// child contracts.
/// - Providing a central internal function `__smart_redeemLogic` to handle the redemption flow including hooks and
/// event emission.
