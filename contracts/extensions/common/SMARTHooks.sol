/// @title Abstract Contract for SMART Token Operation Hooks
/// @notice This abstract contract defines a set of standardized `internal virtual` hook functions
///         that can be triggered at various points in a SMART token's lifecycle (e.g., before a mint,
///         after a transfer). Extensions can override these hooks to inject custom logic.
/// @dev The hooks are empty by default (`internal virtual { }`). This means that if an extension
///      doesn't need to react to a specific lifecycle event, it doesn't need to implement that hook.
///      The key design principle here is that when an extension *does* override a hook,
///      it should **always call `super.hookName()` first** within its implementation.
///      This ensures that if multiple extensions are used and they all override the same hook,
///      a chain of calls is maintained, allowing all extensions to execute their logic.
///      For example:
///      `function _beforeMint(address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {`
///      `    super._beforeMint(to, amount); // Call parent/previous hook first!`
///      `    // Custom logic for this extension...`
///      `}`
///      An 'abstract contract' provides a template or partial implementation, and cannot be deployed directly.
///      `internal virtual` functions are callable only from the contract itself or derived contracts,
///      and they are designed to be overridden.
