/// @title Upgradeable SMART Token Extension Base
/// @notice This abstract contract serves as a foundational base for all upgradeable SMART token extensions.
///         It combines common SMART functionalities with an upgradeable ERC20 token framework.
///         'Upgradeable' means the contract's logic can be changed after deployment via a proxy pattern,
///         without changing the contract's address.
/// @dev It inherits from `Initializable` (for managing initialization in upgradeable contracts),
///      `_SMARTExtension` (for common SMART logic and hooks), and OpenZeppelin's `ERC20Upgradeable`.
///      It provides an implementation for `_smartSender()` from `SMARTContext` by delegating to `_msgSender()`,
///      which in `ERC20Upgradeable` (via `ContextUpgradeable` and potentially `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable`
///      if further inherited) can support meta-transactions.
///      The constructor calls `_disableInitializers()` to prevent re-initialization of this base contract part
///      when an inheriting contract is initialized through a proxy. This is a standard safety measure for
///      OpenZeppelin Upgradeable contracts.
///      The comment "These hooks should be called first in any override implementation" is a general guideline
///      for developers extending SMART hooks: always call `super.hookFunction(...)` in overrides.
