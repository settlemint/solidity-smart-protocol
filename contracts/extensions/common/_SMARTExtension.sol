///         both standard and upgradeable. It provides fundamental shared functionalities like
///         interface registration for ERC165 support and inherits core SMART interfaces and hook definitions.
/// @dev It inherits `ISMART` (the core interface for SMART tokens, defining functions like `onchainID`,
///      `identityRegistry`, etc.), `SMARTContext` (for a consistent way to get the transaction sender),
///      and `SMARTHooks` (which defines the standard set of lifecycle hooks like `_beforeMint`).
///      The `_isInterfaceRegistered` mapping and `_registerInterface` function are used to implement
///      ERC165 introspection, allowing other contracts to query if a SMART token supports a specific extension
/// interface.
///      An 'abstract contract' is a template and cannot be deployed directly.

    ///      indicating if that interface is supported (`true`) or not (`false`).
    ///      This allows for an efficient O(1) (constant time) lookup when checking for interface support

     *      their initialization phase (constructor for standard, or an initializer function for upgradeable).
     *      By calling this, an extension signals that it implements all functions defined in the given interface.
     *      For example, a burnable extension would call `_registerInterface(type(ISMARTBurnable).interfaceId);`.
     *      This populates the `_isInterfaceRegistered` mapping.
     * @param interfaceId The `bytes4` identifier of the interface to register (e.g.,
     * `type(IMyExtensionInterface).interfaceId`).
     *                    The `type(IMyInterface).interfaceId` expression automatically calculates the correct ERC165
     * ID.
