/// @title Standard (Non-Upgradeable) SMART Token Extension Base
/// @notice This abstract contract serves as a foundational base for all standard (non-upgradeable)
///         SMART token extensions. It combines common SMART functionalities with a standard ERC20 token.
/// @dev It inherits from `_SMARTExtension` (which provides common SMART logic like interface registration
///      and hook definitions via `SMARTHooks`) and OpenZeppelin's `ERC20.sol` (the standard ERC20 token
/// implementation).
///      It provides a concrete implementation for `_smartSender()` from `SMARTContext` by delegating to
///      `_msgSender()` from OpenZeppelin's `Context.sol` (which `ERC20.sol` inherits).
///      This ensures that extensions built on `SMARTExtension` have access to both ERC20 token features
///      and the SMART framework's context and hook system.
///      An 'abstract contract' is a template and cannot be deployed directly; it must be inherited.
///      The comment "These hooks should be called first in any override implementation" is a reminder
///      to developers creating new extensions that if they override any hook (e.g., `_beforeMint` from `SMARTHooks`),
///      they should typically call `super._beforeMint(...)` to ensure the original hook logic (and any other
///      extensions' logic) is also executed.

    ///      It directly calls `_msgSender()` which, in a standard non-ERC2771 context (as provided by `ERC20.sol`
    ///      via `Context.sol`), will return `msg.sender` (the direct caller of the contract).

    ///      - `view`: Does not modify state.
    ///      - `virtual`: Can be overridden by further derived contracts.
    ///      - `override(SMARTContext)`: Specifically states it's overriding `_smartSender` from `SMARTContext`.
