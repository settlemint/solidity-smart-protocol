/// @title ISMART Compliance Oracle Interface
/// @notice This interface defines the functions for a central compliance contract designed to work with SMART tokens.
/// Its primary role is to determine the legality of token operations (transfers, mints, burns) by orchestrating checks
/// across one or more registered compliance modules.
/// @dev The main compliance contract acts as a gateway or an oracle for compliance decisions.
/// It typically holds a list of active compliance modules and their specific parameters for a given token.
/// - `canTransfer`: A view function to pre-check if an operation is allowed.
/// - `transferred`, `created`, `destroyed`: Hooks called by the token *after* an operation has successfully occurred,
/// allowing modules to update state or log.
/// - Module Validation: Functions to validate compliance modules before they are added to a token's configuration.
/// This contract itself usually doesn't implement specific rules but delegates them to individual
/// `ISMARTComplianceModule` contracts.
