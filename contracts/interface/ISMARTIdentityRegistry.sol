/// @title ISMARTIdentityRegistry Interface
/// @author SettleMint
/// @notice This interface defines the standard functions for an Identity Registry contract within the SMART protocol.
///         It is designed to be compatible with ERC-3643 (Tokenized Asset Standard) and OnchainID.
///         The primary role of this registry is to manage the crucial link between an investor's wallet address,
///         their decentralized on-chain Identity contract (implementing `IIdentity`), and their verification status
///         based on claims issued by trusted entities.
/// @dev This registry acts as a central point of truth for associating wallet addresses with digital identities.
///      It relies on two other key components:
///      1. `ISMARTIdentityRegistryStorage`: A separate contract responsible for storing the actual mappings
///         between investor addresses, identity contracts, and country codes. This separation of concerns allows
///         for upgradability and different storage strategies.
///      2. `IERC3643TrustedIssuersRegistry`: A contract that maintains a list of trusted entities (claim issuers)
///         whose attestations (claims) about an identity are considered valid.
///      Operations like registering a new identity or checking if an identity is verified are performed through this
/// interface.
/// This interface extends IERC165 for interface detection support.
