/// @title ISMART Token Interface
/// @notice This interface defines the comprehensive set of functions, events, and errors for a SMART token.
/// A SMART token extends standard ERC20 functionality (token transfers, balances) and ERC20Metadata (name, symbol,
/// decimals)
/// with advanced features for regulatory compliance and identity management.
/// @dev Key features encapsulated by this interface include:
/// - Standard ERC20 operations (transfer, approve, balanceOf, etc. - inherited).
/// - Token metadata (name, symbol, decimals - inherited).
/// - Integration with an Identity Registry (`ISMARTIdentityRegistry`) for verifying token holders.
/// - Integration with a main Compliance contract (`ISMARTCompliance`) to enforce transfer rules.
/// - Management of modular compliance rules through individual Compliance Modules.
/// - Configuration of required claim topics for identity verification.
/// - Functions for minting, batch minting, batch transfers, and recovering mistakenly sent ERC20 tokens.
/// - Events for all significant state changes and operations.
/// - Custom errors for specific failure conditions.
/// This interface is intended to be implemented by concrete SMART token contracts.
/// This interface extends IERC165 for interface detection support.
