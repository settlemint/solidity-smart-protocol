/// @notice This interface defines the standard functions that all individual compliance modules within the SMART
/// protocol
///         must implement. Compliance modules are specialized contracts that enforce specific rules or actions
///         related to token transfers, minting, and burning. They are managed by a central `ISMARTCompliance` contract.
/// @dev Each compliance module can be thought of as a pluggable rule set. For example, one module might enforce
///      KYC/AML checks, another might restrict transfers to certain geographic locations, and yet another might
///      impose daily transfer limits. This modular design allows for flexible and extensible compliance frameworks.
///      This interface inherits from IERC165 for contract interface detection (supportsInterface).
